# GA4 + GTM Implementation – DM Course Store Website

This project showcases the end-to-end implementation of **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** and **Google Tag Manager (GTM)** on a custom-built educational website named **DA Course Store**. It includes full event tracking, configuration, user segmentation, reporting, and exploration — all documented in a 30-page case study with screenshots.

## 📂 Files Included

- `GA4-GTM-CaseStudy.pdf` – Full case study with setup steps, screenshots, event tracking, reports, and insights.
- `gtm_dacoursestore_container.json` – Exported GTM container with all tags, triggers, and variables.

## 🧠 Key Highlights

- Tracked custom events: clicks, form submissions, file downloads, YouTube views, element visibility.
- GA4 configuration with enhanced measurement setup, data stream config, filters, and custom dimensions.
- GTM setup with custom variables, dataLayer triggers, and tag implementation.
- User property segmentation using `user_type` (Beginner, Professional) with detailed comparison logic.
- Explored all GA4 exploration techniques: funnel, path, segment overlap, cohort, and free-form reports.
- Debugged data using GTM Preview Mode and GA4 DebugView with real-time verification.

## 🌐 Project Website (Demo)

[https://dacoursestore.netlify.app/](https://dacoursestore.netlify.app/)

This demo site was built for educational purposes to simulate GA4 + GTM event tracking across form submissions, video views, user segmentation, and interactive elements.

## 🎓 Learnings

- Developed a strong foundation in GA4 architecture, tagging strategy, and exploration-based analysis.
- Learned how to implement dynamic user segmentation using `user_type` via dataLayer.push().
- Understood the role of data filters, event scopes (event/user), and metric configuration.
- Practiced debugging with GTM Preview & GA4 DebugView to validate real-time data flow.
- Designed a tracking plan that mimics real-world business funnel use cases like form engagement and conversion.
